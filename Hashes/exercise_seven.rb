NoMethodError: undefined method 'keys' for Array

A. We're missing keys in array variable.
B. There is no method called keys for Array objects.
C. keys is an Array object, but it hasn't been defined yet
D. There's an array of strings, and we're trying to get the string keys out of the array, but it doesn't exist.


B - keys is a hash method, not an array method as it is an ordered list, not a list of key-value pairs
