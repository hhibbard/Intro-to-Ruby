#merge will return a new hash containing the combination of hash arrays

#merge! will return a new hash containing the combination of hash arrays
#as with the merge method, if there are duplicate values assigned to a key
#it will return the second value
#this method mutates the original hash (overwrites original values to permanently
#change the array)
